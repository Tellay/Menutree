Menutree is an online platform for restaurants to create their digital menus and serve them as a QRCode as a way to save papers and make Earth more sustainable.
<br/>
<br/>

> NOTE: Menutree is under active development.

# Motivation

The main motivation behind Menutree is to save the Earth. We are using a lot of papers to print the menu cards and those are being thrown away after a single use. This is not sustainable and has a huge impact on the environment.

# Features

- Create your own digital menu
- Add categories and items to the menu
- Add images to the items
- Generate a QRCode for the menu
- Customers can scan the QRCode and view the menu on their mobile phones
